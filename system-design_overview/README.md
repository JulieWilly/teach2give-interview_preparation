#Undestanding system design.

System design is a base concept in software engineerng that provides a procedural process of defining software architecture, modules, components, etc. It is an important aspect to consider when building scalable and reliable softwares.
During interviews, system desing is one of the keys concepts that interviewers test to check the interviewers ability to think about building application's architecture from scratch.

## Need for system desing.
Basically, system design is used to prepare the architecture of the software or an application, thus, it is necessary to design the system before writing the code.

System requirements (both functional and non-functional) higly influence the design of a system bacause developers have to prepare an architecture that fulfils the requirements. For instance, based on the data to be store for a specific application, the developer has to determine if they will use SQL or NoSQL databases. System design also enables developers to make the application scalable in case the traffic increases. One of the best solution to controlling traffic is having multiples servers in different locations to serve users nearest to them to make their application efficient.
